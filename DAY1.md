# Listening and connecting
Challenges:
1. Make `nc` continue listening on a port even after you've connected to
   it and subsequently disconnected from it. (hint: you can run any
program in an infinite loop via `while true; do my_command; done`
1. Try to listen to port 400 on your local machine? What happens? What's
   the port number where you start getting a different response?
1. Try to listen to the same port with two programs at the same time.
   What happens?
1. Listen on a port in such a way that all of the data sent to that port
   gets redirected to a file. (hint: you're going to need to do the
normal listen command and then use the '>' character afterward for
sending the programs "standard output" to a file.)
1. Connect to a port that you're listening on and send the contents of a file into that port. Try to get those file contents to display in the terminal that is listening on that port.

# HTTP requests and responses
Challenges:
1. Connect to http://motherfuckingwebsite.com and save just the http headers to a file (hint: youâ€™ll want to use either the program `split` or `head`)
1. Connect to an HTTPS website using `openssl s_client` (hint: you may need to read `openssl s_client -h` and/or Google for a solution)
1. Try the above challenges using `curl` instead of `nc`. How goddamned
   much easier is this? Try an HTTPS website with curl, too.
1. Run curl with the command line option that prints out only the HTTP
   response headers, not the response body itself

# The Rack interface
Challenges:
1. Make a server that listens on port 2000 and another that listens on
   port 3000 in the same Ruby file. Connect to them both with curl.
1. Make a server that creates an HTTP response somehow customized to the
   HTTP request (hint: check env['PATH_INFO'] for a value that's easily customizable via `curl`)
1. Refactor your Ruby code to be way less ugly. Name things well.
1. See what happens when you provide the wrong kinds of data to the rack
   response. A string for the final argument? How about an integer? What
if you have a blank HTTP header hash? What if you use an invalid status
code?
